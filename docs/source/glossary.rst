    fragility
        Fragility "implies easily damaged or broken, but is often used to
        describe the probability of a stated level of damage for a specific
        hazard, e.g. an earthquake." Fragility measures probability.

    fragility function
    fragility curves
        Fragility function is a mathematical function that expresses the
        relationship between the probability of occurrence of some undesirable
        event and some measure of environmental excitation. In our case the the
        undesirable event is a facility or component reaching or exceeding some
        clearly defined limit state, and the environmental excitation is
        an earthquake of a defined intensity measure.

    vulnerability
        Vulnerability refers to the concept of susceptibility of damage for
        a given entity. The entity can be a civil structure, a critical
        infrastructure facility, a component within such a facility, or
        a subset of population within a defined geographical area, etc.
        Vulnerability measures loss.

    vulnerability function
        Vulnerability function is a mathematical function that depicts loss
        as a function of environmental excitation.
        It has several synonyms: vulnerability curves, damage functions,
        loss functions.
