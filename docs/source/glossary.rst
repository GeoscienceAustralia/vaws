    |Cpe|
        external pressure coefficient

    influence coefficient
        coefficient relating a connection to either zone or connection with regard to load distribution

    |Cpi|
        internal pressure coefficient

    |qz|
        free stream wind pressure

    |Mz,cat|
        terrain height multiplier

    |Ms|
        shielding multiplier. This multiplier represents the reduction in peak 3-second gust velocity at a given height and terrain, caused by the presence of buildings and other obstructions upwind of the site of interest.

    fragility
        Fragility "implies easily damaged or broken, but is often used to
        describe the probability of a stated level of damage for a specific
        hazard, e.g. an earthquake." Fragility measures probability.

    fragility function
    fragility curves
        Fragility function is a mathematical function that expresses the
        relationship between the probability of occurrence of some undesirable
        event and some measure of environmental excitation. In our case the the
        undesirable event is a facility or component reaching or exceeding some
        clearly defined limit state, and the environmental excitation is
        an earthquake of a defined intensity measure.

    vulnerability
        Vulnerability refers to the concept of susceptibility of damage for
        a given entity. The entity can be a civil structure, a critical
        infrastructure facility, a component within such a facility, or
        a subset of population within a defined geographical area, etc.
        Vulnerability measures loss.

    vulnerability function
        Vulnerability function is a mathematical function that depicts loss
        as a function of environmental excitation.
        It has several synonyms: vulnerability curves, damage functions,
        loss functions.
