Vulnerability and Adaptation to Wind Simulation (VAWS) is a software tool that can be used to model the vulnerability of small buildings such as domestic houses and light industrial sheds to wind. The primary use-case of VAWS is the examination of the change in vulnerability afforded by mitigation measures to upgrade a buildingâ€™s resilience to wind hazard.
